Come join us for the next informal social get together for all Tasmanian QGIS users.  
Let's meet over a drink to chat about the software or just to socialise with like-minded people.  
Last time we adjourned to Danphe Nepalese Restaurant and had a wonderful meal together. We would like to do something similar in September which we can discuss on the night.  

*Jump onto the [QGIS AU Discussion list](https://groups.google.com/g/australian-qgis-user-group) to RSVP and be notified of updates as they happen.*
