Come join us for the next informal social get together for all Tasmanian QGIS users and see the year out.
Let’s meet over a drink to chat about the software or just to socialise with like-minded people. In addition, some may have been to the recent Auckland FOSS4G conference and will have stories to share.
If you wish to have a meal together afterward, we can discuss options on the night.
Jump onto the [QGIS AU Discussion list](https://groups.google.com/g/australian-qgis-user-group) to be notified of updates as they happen!
