On Friday 15th August, a small but enthusiastic group of QGIS users met at Hadley’s Hotel in Hobart for the very first Tasmania QGIS User Group gathering.

The meetup was a chance to connect, share stories, and start building a supportive community of QGIS users across the state. While this first catch-up was in Hobart, we’ve chosen to call ourselves a Tasmania-wide group. We already had attendees from outside Hobart, and we want to encourage others scattered around the state to join future events.

The plan is to keep things social and informal, with occasional more structured events. We also see this group as complementary to existing initiatives like GeoRabble, since many spatial professionals use a mix of software tools alongside QGIS.

Looking further ahead, we’re excited about the idea of possibly holding a symposium next year. This would bring together local and visiting QGIS users to showcase practical examples of how QGIS is being used in different fields and projects.

If you’re interested in being part of the community, keep an eye out for updates on our next meetup — we’d love to see more faces from across Tasmania!
 
The next function will be posted shortly. Be sure to make contact via the [QGIS Australia Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/australian-qgis-user-group) if interested in attending.

Thanks to our sponsor, Dean Howell from [GISjobs Australia](https://gisjobs.com.au) for kindly sponsoring the event.
