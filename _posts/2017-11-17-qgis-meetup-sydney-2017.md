This was our first big event. We had around 60 people come to the University of Sydney for a fun day of QGIS talks and socialising.

[This wiki page](https://github.com/qgisau/meetups/wiki/Australian-QGIS-user-group-meetup-2017) has more details, and [all the talks were recorded and are available here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQbaw-XC9jWFsTbZlIyoYLGsE4iZEUjFM)
